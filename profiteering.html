			<h1>Corporate Profiteering of Prisons:
Making a Buck off the Man Down on His Luck
			</h1>
		<br />
			<p>If you think that slavery does not exist in America, think again. Private prisons "employ" their inmates to produce products, ranging anywhere from bacon to women's panties. Now, some prison labor is good, such as a prisoner who works the prison kitchen or a prisoner in charge of the inmates' laundry. The question is this: how much pay should these prisoners be compensated for their labors?<br />
Let us look at how much money private prisoners currently make from their toils: the average inmate earns about 93 cents an hour, with the lowest of that spectrum making about 16 cents per hour. However, the Percy Amendment to the Justice Improvement Act mandates that these working inmates make at least the federal minimum wage. So why are the actual earnings so low? Well, it is because of Legal Finance Obligations (LFOs) that deduct almost 80% of an inmate's wages. These are, disturbingly enough, completely legal deductions no doubt from laws passed under the influence of corporate lobbying efforts. 93 cents an hour is a slave wage. Add that to the fact that the U.S. incarcerates minorities at an inexcusable rate, and you'll amount to what is now the new face of slavery in America. </p>
