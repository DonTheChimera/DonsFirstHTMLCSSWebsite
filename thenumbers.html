			<h1>Incarceration by the Numbers:<br />
				Calculated Damnation
</h1>
		<br />
			<p>Now, let's talk about within the U.S. itself. Whites, Hispanics, and Blacks make up about 64%, 16%, and 13% of the total U.S. population (including both prisoners and citizens), respectively. However, the rate of incarceration for each of these demographics varies in an almost comical proportion. 
			Whites comprise 39% of the total prisoner population, Hispanics: 19%, and Blacks make up a whopping 40%. 
			This is fucking outrageous. Let's break it down a bit further as it pertains to adult males. 0.7% of adult White males are in prison, while somehow 4.7% of adult Black males are in prison, and 1.8% of adult Hispanic males are in prison.
			Blacks have a rate of incarceration that is almost seven times as high as that of Whites. Hispanics almost triple the rate of Whites in prison. There is also no data that supports these numbers being the result of wildly varying racial/ethnic group crime rates. Every racial demographic under the sun commits crime at relatively the same rate, and even slight variations in crime rates could not account for this disparate amount of incarceration. There is no way that Blacks are committing seven times the crime that Whites do, nor are there any tangible, substantive differences in the rates at which these communities commit crime other than the obvious: racial profiling by police, compounded by the "War on Drugs". But that is another debate entirely.
