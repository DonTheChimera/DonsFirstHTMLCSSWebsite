			<h1>Prison Conditions:
Separate but Unequal
			</h1>
		<br />
		<p>Many ex-correctional officers of private prisons, and many accounts from ex-prisoners (I would refer to them as rehabilitated prisoners, but we don't really care about that in America) themselves outline the conditions of working in these prisons from both sides of the bars -and what they've detailed is a dismal, failed attempt at incarceration. You'd think since these prisoners will hopefully rejoin society one day that we would take their incarceration more seriously, and actually try to rehabilitate them in a meaningful way. These people will be our neighbors someday, and should be treated as if we were trying to help them become better neighbors in their lives after prison. This is not the case, and prison reform is a topic for another debate. Here, rather, let us peer into the conditions of these for-profit, private prisons. A simple internet search about working in a private prison will yield many instances of such personal accounts. They all point to one conclusion: conditions in private prisons are worse than public prisons.

In an article published in Time magazine from 2016 by Joseph Margulies, the then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates for the U.S. (now ousted by the world's most notorious cheeto-human) said that private prisons "compare poorly to public prisons. How do they compare poorly? Well, "the DOJ found that, in general, private prisons provide fewer correctional services at greater security and safety risk to inmates and staff, without producing substantial savings" (Margulies 2016)  is precisely how. To save money (not including the profit made from the products of the slave-wages that private prisons pay their prison laborers), private prisons pay their Correctional Officers almost 76% what their public counterparts make. Reports of poor training programs and deteriorating facilities --in coordination with the lack of basic services such as mental health services-- are another cost-cutting method used by these private prisons. But these cost-cutting tools fail at saving any remarkable amount of money for the Department of Justice. These conditions lead to a riskier environment for prisoners and Correctional Officers alike, hardly justifying the miniscule amount of cash saved through their questionable practices.
